    <p><strong> Do you believe in love, and no not the kind of love you give to you're family. But the love with another person. I've never been in that kind of love. I've always believed that love will only appear if you know everything and care deeply about that person. As if that person is the only thing you want in life...</strong></p>
    <p><strong> I want to be in that kind of love, the kind of love that make's you feel safe, secure, protected, happy. And I know that love also come's with tension(good or bad), anger, sadness. But if you're really in love, you wouldn't let those thing's affect what you have because your in love. I know I'm coming off strong, I'm a fourteen year old boy who is gay and in an all boys highschool school. Most of the guy's think I came here to find a guy but that was never the case. When it come's to school, I need to be focused on learninng and improving. I don't think I can juggle both love and work...  </strong></p>
    
    <p><strong> You must think I'm crazy since I'm writing a paper about love when I haven't experienced love before. I don't blame you. I mean it's somewhat similar to the question of how can someone know there gay when they haven't slept with the same sex before... I don't believe in thing's like that. I don't know why people are so feaked out by same sex attraction. I mean you don't have to be that open'minded to realize that we are all people. People who have desire's. If a girl cuddles another girl, a majority of the guy's will look at them differently in a slighty good way. However, if a guy cuddles with another guy they get an opposite reaction. I mean how come we benefit a gender for doing something and when another gender does the same exact thing they get hated on by society.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong> But I guess it can come down to one person. God. Lot's of perception's about god are a bit extreme. If you did something good your whole life, you will go to heavan where you will live a happy life.. If you've done something bad. Your off to hell and you suffer for eternity. But could it be because it's the only thing that's keeping them intact. For example, ahcoloics, A majority of ahcoholics go to chruch because it's that one thing that's tieing them away from there enemy. Another example give or take are some preist  who believe's you can create you're own god that'll set you down the right path as it doesn't have to be wether it come's down to heavan or hell. But just you and how you want it. I don't believe in that sort of suff but I don't judge the people who do.</strong></p>
        <p><strong> Unfortunalty, I have to get back to my miserable life all alone with no love. The kind of love with another person that isn't at all related to you!!</strong></p>
